# Endless Evil

## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Jacquel, a once peaceful place now plagued by an infestation of horrid, evil 
beasts. Use your timing skills to battle your way through an endless sea of monsters and defend the 
innocent village you call home. Will you be able to restore the peace to the land? Or will evil 
triumph, and plunge the world into darkness.   

## Description
Ever since I was a little kid, I have had a deep love for video games of all kinds. To me, video
games are a way for you to escape reality and de-stress after a long day. My goal with this app was 
to create a game that could be played any time, anywhere, and that was easy for someone to pick up
and learn. I think that the game accomplishes this through its simple mechanics and graphics. Game
play simply consists of tapping the screen to the tempo of the timing bar on the bottom of the screen.
Well executed timing is rewarded with stronger attacks, and greater chances of evading enemy attacks.
with three different characters to choose from, the user can select one that best fits their 
preferences for damage and health. I hope that someday people will enjoy using my to just
relax, and enjoy a nice simple game. 

## Current State
Currently the user is able to enter into the character select screen by selecting the building on the
left. Here, they can choose one of the three listed characters. Once they have selected a character
that character will appear on the main menu, and in the battle screen, where the user can interact 
with the battle bar to display a number based on how full it was.
