## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Jacquel, where an endless wave of evil beasts are 
trying to terrorize a peaceful village, and you are the only one with the
power to hold them back. Use your timing skills to execute powerful attacks
and evade ones thrown by the enemy. How long can you keep the monsters at
bay while the villagers escape to safety. 

## Description
The Game will begin with the character attack phase, during this phase the battle
bar at the bottom of the screen will begin to rapidly fill and drain until
the screen is tapped. The closer the bar is to being full when stopped, the
more damage the character will do. Next the enemy attack phase will begin,
The bar at the bottom of the screen will behave just as before, but unlike
previously, the goal is to stop the bar at its lowest point. The closer you
get to this, the higher your chance of dodging the enemy attack. These two 
phases repeat up until the point that the enemy or character is defeated. When an
enemy is defeated the character will advance to the next level receive a score 
based on how little damage they took while fighting it. The game will end when
the character's health is reduced to 0, rendering them unable to continue fighting.
The scores from each level will be added together to give a total score.
